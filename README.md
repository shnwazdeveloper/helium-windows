## Where to change things

Use this map when editing the repo:

- GitHub repo README and owner text: `README.md`
- Owner social/profile page in this repo: `OWNER.md`
- Windows installer wrapper metadata: `installer/helium.nsi`
- Windows branding patch used during Chromium packaging:
  `patches/helium/windows/change-branding.patch`
- In-browser About page owner line:
  `patches/helium/windows/about-page-dev-by-shnwaz.patch`
- Version patch used during Chromium packaging:
  `patches/helium/windows/helium-versioning.patch`

The in-browser page shown at `chrome://settings/help` / "About Helium" is not
generated from `README.md` or `installer/helium.nsi`. It comes from the Chromium
source checkout created under `build/src` during the full browser build.

After fetching the Chromium source, find the exact files with:

```powershell
python3 helium-chromium\utils\clone.py -o build\src
rg -n "About Chromium|About Helium|The Helium Authors|IDS_ABOUT_VERSION|open source project" build\src\chrome build\src\components
```

Then add the required source changes as a patch in this repo before running the
full build. Do not change only the installer if you want the browser's internal
About page to change; the installer wrapper and the Chromium UI are separate.
